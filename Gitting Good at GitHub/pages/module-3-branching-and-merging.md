# **What are Branches?**

* A branch lets you work on changes separately from the main code.
  * It is a good habit to always working branches
  * For individual projects, working in `main` is "okay"
  * For team based projects, always need to create branches

---

# **Working with Branches**

* You create a branch with either two approaches:
  * Create a branch `git branch {insert-descriptive-branch-name}`
  * Create and checkout a branch `git checkout -b {insert-descriptive-branch-name}`
* To delete a branch `git checkout main` -> `git branch -D {insert-descriptive-branch-name}`

# **Merging Branches**
<div class="text-2xl">

* To merge a branch locally, you do `git merge {insert-branch-name}`
* It is common to need to merge `main` into current branch because:
  * In your Pull Request, you have merge conflicts you need to address
  * Code has been merged into main that you need for your work
* To merge main into your current branch
  * `git checkout main` (swap to main)
  * `git pull` (update main branch)
  * `git checkout {insert-branch-name}` (swap back to your branch)
  * `git merge main` (merge main into your branch)

# **Merge Conflicts**

* Occurs when changes in two branches **affect the same part of a file** and Git can't automatically decide which change to keep, requiring manual resolution.
