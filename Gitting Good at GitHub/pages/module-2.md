# Getting started working with Repositories

1. [Creating a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/quickstart-for-repositories)
2. [Forking a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository)

Once a repository has been created or forked, you can then clone a repository with

```bash
git clone {repository link}
```
