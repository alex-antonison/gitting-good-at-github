# What is Version Control?

* Version control is a tool that allows you to track changes to files over time.
* This is most effective when working with text files but also works with other files.

---

# What are the benefits of Version Control?

* **Track Changes.** You can see who changed what to files over time.
* **File History.** Ability to revert back to previous versions of a file.
* **Collaboration.** Supports collaborating in files.

# What is Git?

* Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes.
* Changes are tracked locally on your computer and then synchronized with a remote repository (like GitHub).
* Each change is saved as a snapshot, not just differences.
* Enables offline work and syncing changes when you're ready.
