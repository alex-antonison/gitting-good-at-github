# What is Version Control?

* Version control is a tool that allows you to track changes to files over time.
* This is most effective when working with text files but also works with other files.

---

# What are the benefits of Version Control?

* **Track Changes.** You can see who changed what to files over time.
* **File History.** Ability to revert back to previous versions of a file.
* **Collaboration.** Supports collaborating in files.

# What is Git?

* Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes.
* Changes are tracked locally on your computer and then synchronized with a remote repository (like GitHub).
* Each change is saved as a snapshot, not just differences.
* Enables offline work and syncing changes when you're ready.

# Key Git Concepts

* **Repository (repo).** A directory where Git stores the history of your project.
* **Commit.** A snapshot of your changes, along with a message describing what was done.
* **Branch.** A parallel version of your project for experimenting or developing new features.
* **Merge.** Combines changes from one branch into another, integrating work from different sources.
